	<h1>Style Guide</h1>

	<p lang="en">A style guide is a set of standards for the writing and design of documents, either for general use or for a specific publication, organization, or field. It is often called a style sheet, though that term has other meanings.</p>

	<p lang="en">A style guide establishes and enforces style to improve communication. To do that, it ensures consistency within a document and across multiple documents and enforces best practice in usage and in language composition, visual composition, orthography and typography. For academic and technical documents, a guide may also enforce the best practice in ethics such as authorship, research ethics, and disclosure, pedagogy such as exposition and clarity, and compliance both technical and regulatory.</p>
